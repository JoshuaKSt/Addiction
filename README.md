# Ligands and Receptors- A Love Story

## Overview

This project takes a methadone ligand and binds it against the mu-opioid receptor. The AutoDock vina simulation script is being made to run with any ligand and receptor pdb file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install RDKit**: This step will likely be temporary- an easy installation of RDKit in an Anoconda environment is detailed at: https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html

2. **Find Ligand**: To run a test simulation you can simply use the included 'Methadone.py' script. To see the molecules Chirality you can use 'Chirality.py'

3. **Find Receptor**: My test structure is 8E0G from: https://www.rcsb.org/
| The script 'ReceptorPruning.py' can be used to deal with simple structural errors or conflicts.

4. **[Simulation WIP]**: This file will be titled 'Docking.py'
